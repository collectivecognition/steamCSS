steamCSS
========

A recreation of Valve's Steam UI from scratch in pure CSS. Created in an afternoon as an exercise to learn (less)[http://lesscss.org/]. Hand coded using only a screenshot of the site, it's not meant to be feature complete; more an experiment to learn, practice and test out some new techniques.

Features include:

* All colors and gradients are generated from a small handful of base less color variables, making it stupidly simple to customize the look
* 100% CSS besides a handful of creative commons images used for filler content and a few sprites inlined as data-uris
* No javascript used for dropdown menus
* Javascript-free image gallery uses a novel technique involving radio-buttons
